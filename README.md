# Unsupervised Learning in Medical Image Segmentation

## Introduction

This repository contains the source codes and test results for the final project of CS 482/682: Machine Learning: Deep Learning at Johns Hopkins University.

Segmentation of lesions is an important task for artificial intelligence. AI segmentation usually falls within the role of supervised learning which requires a large, manually annotated training dataset. Our project aims to address this shortcoming in supervised approaches by exploring unsupervised approaches.

Specifically, we implemented two approaches: 3DUnet with Kmeans and 3D clustering CNN with Deep Q Network. We also implemented a supervised vanilla 3D-Unet as a baseline model to compare with. We evaluated the performance by segmentation accuracy and total runtime.

See the report for details.
